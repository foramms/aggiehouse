How can we create an app/program that will send out text reminders to volunteers about their shifts so that volunteer absenteeism cna be decreased?

- Volunteer shifts may be forgotten due to busy schedules
- Currently uses a Google Sheet calendar to display scheduled shifts
- Lacks a reminder system for volunteer shifts
